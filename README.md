# DevForge MCP

**"One forge for every stage of your dev workflow."**

DevForge MCP is a Go-based MCP server that acts as a transversal intelligence layer and utility toolkit across the software development lifecycle. It exposes a rich set of tools — for code, architecture, design, media processing, and documentation — through the MCP stdio transport, making it accessible to any MCP-compatible AI client.

Built around a SQLite-backed pattern store with FTS5 search and optional vector embeddings, it provides specialized skills and sub-agents that work together to reduce friction at every phase: from initial architecture decisions to production-ready interfaces and optimized media assets.

## Key Capabilities

- **Multimedia optimization** — Compress and convert images, video, and audio for the web using the DevPixelForge Rust engine (with FFmpeg).
- **Design system management** — Store, search, and retrieve UI patterns, design tokens, color palettes, and architecture diagrams.
- **Layout analysis & generation** — Audit existing layouts and generate new ones adapted to any supported frontend stack.
- **MCP tool surface** — Works as an MCP server so any AI client (Claude, OpenCode, Copilot, etc.) can invoke its tools via stdio.
- **CLI/TUI companion** — A Bubble Tea-based terminal interface for browsing patterns, launching audits, and configuring integrations without leaving the terminal.
- **Specialized skills** — Extends capabilities through configurable skills and sub-agents for frontend, backend, architecture, documentation, and QA.
- **Cross-stack** — A common tool for frontend, backend, infrastructure, and automation.

## Current Frontend Stack Support

The UI and design tools adapt their output to the declared stack:

- Vanilla JS/TS + modern CSS SPA (Vite 8).
- Astro, Next.js, SvelteKit, Nuxt.js.
- Tailwind CSS v4+ with the official Vite plugin:
  - Importing `@import "tailwindcss";` in a single CSS file.
  - Design tokens in CSS instead of `tailwind.config.js`.

## Components

- `cmd/devforge-mcp/`
  - Go MCP server with SQLite/FTS5, optionally libSQL.
  - Current tools:
    - **UI/Design**: `analyze_layout`, `suggest_layout`, `manage_tokens`, `store_pattern`, `list_patterns`, `suggest_color_palettes`
    - **Images**: `optimize_images`, `generate_favicon`, `generate_ui_image` (requires Gemini API key)
    - **Video**: `video_transcode`, `video_resize`, `video_trim`, `video_thumbnail`, `video_profile`
    - **Audio**: `audio_transcode`, `audio_trim`, `audio_normalize`, `audio_silence_trim`
    - **Config**: `configure_gemini`, `ui2md`

- `cmd/devforge/`
  - Go CLI/TUI built with Bubble Tea for:
    - Browsing patterns and architectures.
    - Launching layout audits.
    - Generating layouts, images, and favicons.
    - Processing video and audio.
    - Exploring color palettes.
    - Configuring integrations (Gemini API key, etc.) from the Settings view.

- `db/devforge.db`
  - SQLite with tables for:
    - `patterns`, `architectures`, `tokens`, `audits`, `assets`, `palettes`.
  - FTS5 virtual tables for efficient full-text search.

- `internal/dpf/`
  - Go bridge to the DevPixelForge Rust multimedia processing engine.
  - Binary: `bin/dpf`.
  - Supports: images (resize, optimize, convert, favicon), video (transcode, resize, trim, thumbnail, profile), audio (transcode, trim, normalize, silence_trim).
  - Requires FFmpeg for video/audio operations.
  - See [`internal/dpf/INTEGRATION.md`](internal/dpf/INTEGRATION.md).

## Configuration

Shared config file between the MCP server and the CLI:

```
~/.config/devforge/config.json
```

Override with the `DEV_FORGE_CONFIG` environment variable.

## System Requirements

- **Go 1.24+** with CGO enabled (`CGO_ENABLED=1`)
- **FFmpeg 6.0+** (for video/audio operations)
- **Rust toolchain** (only if recompiling the `dpf` binary)
